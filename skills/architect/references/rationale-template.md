# Rationale template

The prose that ships alongside the type sketch. One page. Sentence-case headings, no boilerplate. Replace the italic notes with actual content.

## Problem

*One paragraph. What we're trying to do, and what about the existing system or constraints makes the shape non-obvious. If [Phase A](../SKILL.md#phase-a-ground-the-problem) surfaced constraints the design must honor (existing types to interop with, callers we can't break, invariants that crossed our boundary), name them here so the reader sees the same constraints you saw.*

## Usage (caller's view)

*Write this first, before the type sketch. Show the README or quickstart the consumer reads, plus two or three realistic call sites in their own code. What they import, what they call, what comes back. The type sketch in [Shape](#shape) is derived from this. The two must agree. When they diverge, reconcile the sketch to the usage, not the reverse. The caller's experience is the spec. The types serve it.*

## Shape

*The recommended architecture. Data structures first. Then how data flows through the signatures. Name the load-bearing decisions. State which invariants are encoded in types, where validation lives, and what the system deliberately does not do. Judge interface depth explicitly. State what complexity the public surface hides, what remains exposed to callers, and why the interface is no larger than needed. Cite the principle behind each decision (e.g., `per boundary-discipline`). Don't restate it.*

## Decision

*Why this shape won. When you wrote a second sketch, name what you kept from it and what you rejected. When you wrote one sketch, name the constraint that made it the shape.*

## Tradeoffs accepted

*One bullet per tradeoff the chosen shape makes. Form: "we accept X in exchange for Y." Name anything a future reader might mistake for an oversight, including things that look like premature optimization or premature simplification.*

## Alternatives considered

*Name a concrete alternative when you actually weighed one, with one line on why it lost. Judge it on interface depth. Name the complexity it exposes to callers and the complexity it hides. When the constraints left a single viable shape, say that in one sentence. Do not invent a second shape to fill the section.*

## Open questions and risks

*Things you noticed during the sketch that the human needs to weigh in on, and risks worth flagging before implementation starts. Phrase as questions, not assertions, so the human's answer is the resolution rather than a comment.*

## Next implementation step

*The first thing to build against the sketch. One sentence. What you would write first once the sketch is the contract. After Phase C when a checkpoint was requested.*
